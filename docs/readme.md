# Documentation
Ready to have your take using Strate? You're at the right place.

There are three sections in this documentation:

- [The usage guide](./usage-guide.md)
- The API reference
- The middleware reference

If you are new to Strate, you should start reading the usage guide first. 

If you're looking to have a deeper look at how Strate works or read detailed information about its functions, you should 
read the API reference.

Finally, the middleware reference is where you'll find all the information you need about each middleware that ships 
with Strate.

If you have any doubts or if you feel that something's missing in these docs, feel free to open an issue. I'll do my
best to answer you as soon as possible. Pull requests are always welcome.
